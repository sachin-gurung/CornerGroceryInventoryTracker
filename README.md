1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
     The Corner Grocery Inventory Tracker program is designed to help the Corner Grocer analyze their daily sales records by tracking the frequency of items purchased. It reads a text file containing items purchased throughout the day and offers some functionality such as the ability to search for specific items frequencies, display all items with their frequencies and generate a histogram of item frequencies. This information will help the store rearrange their produce section based on item popularity to enhance customer experience.
   
2. What did you do particularly well?
     This program did well in parsing data from a text file and counting the frequencies. It also has a good user interface where user is given choice 1-4 to interact with the program. The code is also organized in separate classes and functions which is easy to manage, understand and build on it in the future.
   
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I think I could enhance my code more on input validation. It can handle string input for now. But it should also be able to give out error messages if input is out of range 1-4.
   
4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    Parsing the file and updating item frequencies was the most challenging part for me. To overcome this, I had to go through multiple youtube videos and google search different things.
   
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
     Some of the skills that will be transferable to other projects or course works will be input validation, parsing data from files and write data to the files and code organization.
   
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
     I've written excessive in-line comments to provide the details of each functions. I've also consistent in naming conventions to make it easier to read. Having basic error handling and input validation is going to help this program handle unexpected situations. I've also used header files to make it more readable and easier to follow.
